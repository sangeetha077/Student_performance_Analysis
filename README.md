# Student_performance_Analysis

## Project Overview 
This project analyzes students' exam performances based on various demographic, socio-economic, and educational factors. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),visualizations and statistical method we uncover insights about what influences academic outcomes.

The dataset contains scores in three subjects: Math, Reading, and Writing, along with attributes like gender, race/ethnicity, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation.

## Project Workflow 
## Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Understanding data distributions, relationships between variables, and basic trend discovery.

## Statistical Analysis:
Applying statistical methods like correlation analysis, mean/median/mode calculations, hypothesis testing, and group comparisons to validate observed patterns.

## Data Visualization:
Using graphical met
